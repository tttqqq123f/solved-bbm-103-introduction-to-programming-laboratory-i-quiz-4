Within the context of this quiz, you are going to gain experience on using different collections (dictionary, list and their functions) as well as on using File I O. The scenario of this work is receiving a message which is split into multiple packets and transferred over the Internet. Packets are not received in order in which they are sent.

Your program must read the input file, sort the packets and write the completed messages to an output file.

As you see from the input format, each line of input represents a single packet. each line is formatted as given below:

X (tab) Y (tab) message part

X represents message ID, Y represents packet ID. It is guaranteed that there will be no duplicate packets or message IDs.

Example Output:

Message 1

1498 0 The Road goes ever on and on

1498 2 Now far ahead the Road has gone,

1498 3 And I must follow, if I can,

1498 4 Pursuing it with eager feet, 1498 5 Until it joins some larger way

1498 6 Where many paths and errands meet.

1498 7 And whither then? I cannot say.

5181 0 There was plenty of everything left for Frodo.

5181 1 as well as the books, pictures were left in his possession.
